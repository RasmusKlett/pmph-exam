\section{Task1}
In this section we are going to target efficient parallelization of the
\textbf{large} dataset. The main strategy here is to parallelize the two outer
loops which corresponds to the \emph{outer} and \emph{numX} or \emph{numY}
dimensions. Note that each \textbf{tridag} call will be executed sequentially
inside each kernel.

First we will discuss the many code transformation we have performed
next we will look into the individual kernels and discuss why these
are parallelisable.
